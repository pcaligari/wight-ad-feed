# wight-ad-feed

This is a small project aimed at helping my local community to thrive through a little bit of cooperation.  The idea is to advertise each others business by including a small widget on their web site that will serve up adverts for other businesses using the service.

If you are a developer feel free to peruse the code, make amendments and bug fixes and send me a pull request.

If you run an Isle of Wight business and want to participate get in touch.
